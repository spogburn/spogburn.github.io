# Developing a Company Voice and Style

## Problem statement
An agency wanted to start a weekly email newsletter and develop a style that engages clients and customers. This agency works in the tech space building web and mobile applications and desktop software. I developed the content strategy and do much of the writing and editing for this product.

## Highlights

Here are some of my favorite newsletters to date:
- [What is Professionalism?](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/what-is-professionalism-597843)
- [Solving Problems](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/solving-problems-740112)
- [The Comfort of Consistency](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/the-comfort-of-consistency-571600)

## Users
- Potential clients curious about how the company works.
- Individuals in the business community interested in the agency's workspace.
- Technologists interested in business culture.

## Role
I developed the content strategy for this project. I write about 70 percent of the content for this project.

## Process
The research effort took place over three stages.

### I. Persona Development
First I developed a persona for the agency. This discovery process helped establish how the newsletter would sound and what topics were important for the newsletter to cover.

### II. Competitive Analysis
I analyzed several existing email newsletters from companies in similar spaces.

I used this analysis to develop a structure for the email newsletter. I decided on
- A text-based structure, like a letter that arrives in your inbox.
- Regular links in topical areas relevant to the agency's persona.
- A regular self-improvement section.

### III. Style Guide

After conducting research, the strategy I decided on was to have the newsletter feel like a small weekly conversation from the agency that subscribers are "in" on. I also wanted subscribers to know that the agency was interested in their growth as well as its own. I implemented the following style guide:

- Written in a letter-type format, with a salutation of "Hi Friends" or something similar.
- Signed by the author for that week.
- Often includes an anecdote from a workday at the agency, or a story about something that happened at the agency. This anecdote often broadens out to discuss agency culture, management culture, or tech culture.
- Displays the humanity and fallibility of the agency.
- Is positive without bragging.
- Often discusses Hard Things or situations that helped the agency grow.
- Partners with a local business development consultant to include weekly journaling prompts, encouraging reflection and growth.

### IV. Implementation

I implemented the content strategy in early 2021. Viewers can subscribe and see past issues [here](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial). The content that is signed by Stephanie is the content I write.
