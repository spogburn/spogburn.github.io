## Problem statement
Develop onboarding assets for an app called Handshake.

## Users
- Freelancers
- Business owners hiring freelancer workers

## Role
This is a student project from my Foundations of UX Writing course. I conducted all the research and created all the copy for the project.

Handshake is a project management app that allows freelancers to set up projects, collaborate with clients/business owners on project proposals, deadlines and milestones, and get paid via the app.

## Process
I took lengthy copy and transformed it into something succint and direct.

### V. Landing page copy
I was asked to simplify a wordy landing page for the app. Here's what I came up with:

**Headline:**

Handshake simplifies managing projects and payments.

**Body**

Freelancers can easily record hours and charge clients. Business owners can track project progress and make payments with in a few simple steps.

As a freelancer, you can:

- Add up the hours of work you did for your project.
- Send the client a request for payment.
- Subtract all your hours from the budget.
- Keep track of what you’ve been paid.

As a business owner, you can:

- See your project’s budget in real time.
- Pay freelancers for their work.
- Approve and discuss budget estimates.
- Outline project milestones and priorities.

### VI. Onboarding microcopy

I was asked to create microcopy headlines and body text for a variety of onboarding screens. The copy had to work for both business owners and freelancers using the app.

| **Headline** | **Body** |
| Easy project management | Record time, track progress, get paid, no problem. |
| Collaborative budgeting | Agree on how much time and money you want to spend. |
| One-stop project tracking | Log in to easily view project progress. |
| Convenient payments | One-click online billing. |
