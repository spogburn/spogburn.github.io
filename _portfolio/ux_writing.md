# Problem
Every year, over 6 million US job seekers earn an alternative education certification. Yet only 66,000 job seekers were listing alternative certifications on their Indeed profiles.

Indeed needed to encourge job seekers with those skills to add them to their profiles, so employers could find them.

## Impact
After the updates based on this project launched:
- There was a 7% increase in job seekers adding non-traditional education to their profiles
- There was a 9% increase in form completion for job seekers with no college degree.

## Process
I designed content updates to existing form title, label and helper text and collaborated on testing those updates to learn if content changes alone could encourage users to add alternative education to their profiles.

### Role
I collaborated with UX research to understand if we might repurpose our existing form fields to encourage job seekers to provide alternative education information, with taxonomists to understand the impact of proposed changes to an autocompleting form field, and with UX design and product to propose more extensive design solutions.

### User definition
Job seekers adding both traditional and alternative education to their Indeed profiles.

## A/B tests

### Initial screen
I collaborated with research to analyze if our current education form fields could be repurposed to encourage job seekers to provide this information.

### Tested screens
Items with a blue outline were new content for the test.

### Final version
The final version used much of what was tested in the B version. However, due to the difficulty in updating the backend for "Level of education" due to our taxonomy, that field was left unchanged.

### Next steps

The team is evaluating the level of effort to update the backend for the Level of education input. They are also exploring a redesign to see if we can encourage even more job seekers to add alternative education experiences to their profiles.
