Hi! I'm Stephanie. I love people, technology, and words.

User experience research is my passion. I love listening to people and relying on their experiences, thoughts and desires to make applications that meet their needs.

I bring my background in anthropology, web development, and journalism to the work I do as a UX researcher.

I am trained in a variety of styles of qualitative research, have deep experience working on highly technical product teams, and maintain a curiousity about people and their experiences that helps me bring a fresh approach to every research project.
