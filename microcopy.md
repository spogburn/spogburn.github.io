# Case Study: Microcopy, Voice and Tone

## Problem statement
Develop content assets for an app called Handshake. Handshake is a project management app that allows freelancers to set up projects, collaborate on project proposals, deadlines and milestones, and send bills to clients.

## Users
- Freelancers
- Business owners hiring freelancer workers

## Role
This is a student project from my Foundations of UX Writing course. I conducted all the research and created all the copy for the project.

## Process
The research effort took place over several stages.

### I. Vocabulary development
I conducted online research to learn common terminology for freelancers and business owners working with freelancers. This is to develop an app vocabulary for various screens in the app. I parsed the terminology and highlighted words to use as key terms in the app.

#### Freelancer terms

| contract | handshake | agreement | **invoice** |
| **scope** | collect | complete | **payment** |
| deposit | terms | services rendered | EFT |
| milestone | 1099 | billable hours | direct deposit |
| **time tracking** |  CRM | retainer | project management |
| monitor | **budget** | estimate | deadlines |

#### Business owner terms

| **contract** | finances | receipts | accounting |
| bookkeeping |  **estimate** | account management | **budget** |
| tracking | due | productivity | W-9 |
| **rate** | independent contractor | billable hours | direct deposit |
| time tracking | project management | monitor | **deadlines** |

### II. Tagline development
I brainstormed taglines for the app and drafted a set of taglines for marketing to choose from.

| Get work. Get Paid. | Tracking and paying for contract work has never been so simple. |
| Get Work. Get Paid. No Sweat. | Hassle-free project tracking and payments for freelancers. |
| Get work done. | Shake and Go. |
| Let’s shake on it. | All it takes is a handshake. |
| We help you get work done. |  Work and pay made easy. |
| Work and pay made simple. | Simple freelance job tracking and payments. |

### III. App voice
After conducting research into user vocabulary, I used my sense of the app's primary features to develop a voice for the app.

**Words that describe the app's voice:**

- Professional.
- Trustworthy.
- Smart.
- Informative.
- Upbeat.
- Conversational.
- Enthusiastic.

The app voice needs to sound professional, trustworthy and smart because it is an app for doing professional work and dealing with hours and money. Trust is important here. It should be conversational so that it can clearly instruct users on how to use its tracking and billing features correctly. It should be enthusiastic because we are all excited about project work getting done.

### IV. Terms

A styleguide for terms helps the app use consistent language throughout for its set of features. I outlined primary terms and rationales behind them.

**Terms to Use**
- **Agree** - Use to indicate that both parties are accepting the terms of something, such as a budget proposal or terms of service for the app. Often used as the action text of a button text “Agree”
- **Invite** (verb) - Use as a verb for when a user is inviting someone to a project.
- **Invitation** - Use as a noun to refer to an invitation to a project. Do not use Invite as a noun, as we use that as the verb and this could be confusing.
- **Invoice** (noun) - Use to refer to the document that collects freelancer time worked multiplied by hourly rate and is sent to the business owner.
- **Paid** - Use to indicate an invoice has been paid and money has been sent to the freelancer. “Tom just paid you for invoice XX on YY Product”
- **Payment** - Use to describe what the freelancer is requesting and receiving from the business owner. “Kelly requests a payment for invoice XX on YY Product”
- **Project** - Use to refer to what the freelancer is working on and what the business owner is paying for.
- **Record** - Use as a verb to refer to the action of saving a time entry on a project. “Record time”
- **Send**  - Use as a verb to “Send invoice” to a business owner. Do not use “Invoice” as a verb, as we use it as a noun to refer to an invoice document.
- **Timesheet** - Use to refer to the document/location where all hours for a project are recorded.

**Terms not to Use**
- **Log** - Do not use this verb to refer to time tracking. We use “record” instead. Also do not use it in a noun form. Users record time and have a project timesheet. (They do not log time nor do they have a time log).
- **Invoice** (verb) - Do not use Invoice as a verb. Use it as a noun to refer to a document outlining time worked and amount owed based on rate. Using the same term as a noun and a verb can confuse users.
- **Invite** (noun) - Do not use invite as a noun, please refer to Invitation as the noun form. Users can Invite another user to share a project. Once this happens, the result is an Invitation. Users can have pending Invitations, decline Invitations, and accept Invitations. Using the same term as a noun and a verb can confuse users.

### V. Landing page copy
I was asked to simplify a wordy landing page for the app. Here's what I came up with:

**Headline:**

Handshake simplifies managing projects and payments.

**Body**

Freelancers can easily record hours and charge clients. Business owners can track project progress and make payments with in a few simple steps.

As a freelancer, you can:

- Add up the hours of work you did for your project.
- Send the client a request for payment.
- Subtract all your hours from the budget.
- Keep track of what you’ve been paid.

As a business owner, you can:

- See your project’s budget in real time.
- Pay freelancers for their work.
- Approve and discuss budget estimates.
- Outline project milestones and priorities.

| Collaborative budgeting | Agree on how much time and money you want to spend. |
