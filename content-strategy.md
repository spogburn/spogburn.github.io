# Developing a Company Voice and Style

## Problem statement
My company wanted to start a weekly email newsletter and develop a style that engages clients and customers. We're an agency building web and mobile applications and desktop software for a range of clients. I developed the content strategy and do much of the writing and editing for this product.

## Highlights

Here are some of my favorite newsletters to date:
- [Avoiding Tutorial Hell](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/avoiding-tutorial-hell-974804)
- [Solving Problems](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/solving-problems-740112)
- [The Comfort of Consistency](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/radial/issues/the-comfort-of-consistency-571600)

## Users
- Potential clients curious about how the company works.
- Company leaders interested in improving business culture in tech.
- Individuals in the business community interested in the agency workspace.

## Role
I developed the content strategy for this project. I write about 70 percent of the content for this project.

## Process
The research effort took place over three stages.

### I. Persona Development
First I developed a persona for the agency. This discovery process helped establish how the newsletter would sound and what topics were important for the newsletter to cover.

### II. Competitive Analysis
I analyzed several existing email newsletters from companies in similar spaces.

I used this analysis to develop a structure for the email newsletter. I decided on
- A text-based structure, like a letter that arrives in your inbox.
- Regular links in topical areas relevant to the agency's persona.
- A regular self-improvement section to nod to the need for mindfulness in business and life.

### III. Style Guide

After conducting research, the strategy we decided on was to have the newsletter feel like a small weekly conversation from the agency that subscribers are "in" on. We also wanted subscribers to know that the agency was interested in their growth as well as its own. With input from my co-editor, I created the following style guide:

- Written in a letter-type format, with a salutation of "Hi Friends" or something similar.
- Signed by the author for that week.
- Often includes an anecdote from a workday at the agency, or a story about something that happened at the agency. This anecdote often broadens out to discuss agency culture, management culture, or tech culture.
- Displays the humanity and fallibility of the agency.
- Is positive without bragging.
- Often discusses Hard Things or situations that helped the agency grow.
- Partners with a local business development consultant to include weekly journaling prompts, encouraging reflection and growth.

### IV. Implementation

I implemented the content strategy in early 2021 and have been publishing the newsletter weekly since. The content that is signed by Stephanie is the content I write.
