Hi! I'm Stephanie. I love people, technology, and words.

Whether I'm asking mountain bikers how they learn about upcoming races or working to improve a company's onboarding flow, my goal is to help people use technology in a way that works for them.

I love doing this through UX writing and crafting the style and substance of the words we all see when using an application.

My second passion is conducting user research -- listening to people and relying on their experiences, thoughts and desires to make applications that meet their needs.
