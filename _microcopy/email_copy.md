title: "Email Copy"

## Problem statement
Develop new user and departing user emails for an app called Handshake.

## Users
- Freelancers
- Business owners hiring freelancer workers

## Role
This is a student project from my Foundations of UX Writing course. I conducted all the research and created all the copy for the project.

Handshake is a project management app that allows freelancers to set up projects, collaborate with clients/business owners on project proposals, deadlines and milestones, and get paid via the app.

## Process
I researched email copy from other well-known apps and read about best practices for both onboarding and departure emails. I decided to keep the onboading email short and offer a resource for help for the users. One challenge in the onboarding email is that it needed to work for both audience types.

With the departing customer email, I wanted the user to know that their cancellation was successful. I also wanted them to have a chance to give any feedback, and if they did make a mistake or change their mind, offer an easy path to reactivate their account.
